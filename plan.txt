    export data for poly viewing
        and graph

    gen_bowties:
        calculate intersection point
        determine if ray intersects segment


    given 1st division point, calculate 2nd point
        divide poly into slices
        calculate area of each slice
        gen graph of area as fuction of dividing line rotation
        determine division points

display graph of area swept per rotation using qt
